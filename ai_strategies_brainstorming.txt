	Drone (ship with combad AI) strategies
	==========================================


	holdPost()
		- zero or almost zero speed
		- lock on most dangerous target (evaluate of dangerous targets - colision course + short distance + speed, can it fire agains drone ?)
		- fire till target destroyed, then evaluate new target

	cruise()
		- aquire slow-mid speed to constant point
		- lock on closest (most dangerous) target
		- fire till target destroyed, then evaluate new target

	attackAggresive()
		- lock on target
		- accelerate in fire direction
		- fire till target destroyed
		- immediate deceleration to almost zero speed
		- evaluate next target and repeat pattern


	firing solutions :
		- fire ahead of target path
		- evaluate if locked target was hit (hp is shrinking)
		- if target remains intact, consider altering firing solution path ...
